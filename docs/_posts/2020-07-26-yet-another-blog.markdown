Normally I try to satisfy my creativity needs with writing software, documentation or publishing technical papers on topics that I am dealing with in my professional life. These contributions are usually accessible via their appropriate web channels.

I decided to start this blog mainly as an aggregator to refer to such content that is primarily hosted elsewhere but also to allow me to publish other personal post that do not fit to the principal category described above.

If you find such overview of my activities as useful as I do, then this blog is properly serving its purpose. If not, you probably shouldn't be reading this post at the first place.
